<h1>Common Base configuration of BJT (Voltage amplification)</h1>
<p>In this type of configuration we have, the Base terminal of BJT is common<br>
 with both input and output. Where input is provided to the Emitter and output<br>
 is collected from the collector. The circuit of the configuration is shown in<br>
 the figure below. This configuration is used for the voltage gain and current<br>
 buffer. And we have input impedance is low and output impedance is high</p>
<h2>Application</h2>

<p>Common base the configuration is not used for the low-frequency input signal<br>
 and for low frequency operating circuit. Though it is used when there is low <br>
 input impedance is connected or present. Such as preamplifier, in a microphone<br>
 where we have low signal and we have to strengthen it out. So there we use a<br>
 common base configuration.<br>
 While mainly it is used for very high frequency and ultra-high frequency. It is<br>
 because its input capacitance does not affect by the amplification process. Due<br>
 to which high frequency does not degrade or change.</p>
